# XMM7360 modem to USB

This is basically a kernel module version of the python script `xmm2usb` found
in [James Wah's repository](https://github.com/abrasive/xmm7360). Please be
aware that this is a hacky approach that results the device to be reported by
lcpci as:

```
02:00.0 Wireless controller [0d40]: Intel Corporation XMM7360 LTE Advanced Modem (rev ff) (prog-if ff)
	!!! Unknown header type 7f
	Kernel driver in use: xmm7360_usb
```

This is because the module disables the PCIe root port link, breaking all
communication to the device, but the entry stays there because it has a driver
in use. It should be pretty harmless though, and can be fixed by simply
unloading the module with `rmmod` (which will also revert all changes though).

I have tested this to work with my Lenovo X1 Carbon (7th Gen) and do not
guarantee it to work on any other laptop. Improvements are welcome though.

## Installation

**WARNING: There is a risk of bricking your laptop so you better know what you
are doing from here onwards, remember you were warned.**

Simply run the following:

```
make
sudo make install
sudo modprobe xmm7360_usb
```

Then after the modem boots in USB mode follow the instructions in the [original
repository](https://github.com/abrasive/xmm7360) to unlock the modem and set it
to MBIM mode. Just to document it here as well, what worked for me was
connecting to the serial and running:

```
at@nvm:fix_cat_fcclock.fcclock_mode?
at@nvm:fix_cat_fcclock.fcclock_mode=0
at@store_nvm(fix_cat_fcclock)
AT+GTUSBMODE?
AT+GTUSBMODE=7
AT+CFUN?
AT+CFUN=15
```

Everything simply worked on my machine from that onwards, and the automatically
loaded module makes sure that the modem stays in USB mode even through reboots.

## DKMS Module

If you encounter something like following while executing `sudo make install`, you may try installing by DKMS module.

```
At main.c:160:
- SSL error:02001002:system library:fopen:No such file or directory: ../crypto/bio/bss_file.c:69
- SSL error:2006D080:BIO routines:BIO_new_file:no such file: ../crypto/bio/bss_file.c:76
sign-file: certs/signing_key.pem: No such file or directory
  DEPMOD  5.4.0-40-generic
```

1. Install dkms

```
sudo apt install dkms
```

2. Install xmm7360 module by dkms

```
./install_dkms.sh
```

3. Load xmm7360 module

```
sudo modprobe xmm7360_usb
```

If you want to remove this module from dkms tree, use `sudo dkms remove -m xmm7360_usb -v 0.1 --all`
